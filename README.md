## Overview
### Description
[App to organize budget, plan events, and set goals]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity/Organizer
- **Mobile:** Does not require internet access, push notifications for reminders
- **Story:** Planning out your month in advance, combined with keeping track with changes as you go, increases productivity
             and can help
- **Market:** The size of the productivity market is massive. People everywhere are lookng to optimize their lives. This product provides
              a huge value to those who need a push to keep to their schedules, finances, and goals.
- **Habit:** This app is designed to be used daily by users. The budget feature alone will require daily input as people input what they 
             spend. The user will also need to open the app to plan the app with the calendar and view their daily schedules. 
- **Scope:** The scope of the overall idea of this project is too big to be finished by the end of the program, but a stripped down version
             with the basic user stories will still be interesting to build. Our group has a very clear understanding of what we want to accomplish.
